                    <p>Every two or so months Helio would launch full time and part time boot camps at either of its two locations. These camps would focus on teaching Computer Science through the lense of Web Development, diving into the MERN stack and exploring intermediate to advanced topics such as RESTful Architecture and Algorithmic Analyse. Over three years, 11 Immersive and six after hours boot camps were taught while support, through supervision and direction, was provided to over twenty others.</p>
